## Strengths

Date functions as a wrapper for a tm struct from <ctime>, 
giving the user a better interface for using that library for calendar dates.

## Weaknesses

This project is held together with hopes and dreams, I do not know why it has been failing certain CodeGrade tests,
and weird problems were run into during development that required odd workarounds that probably were not good practice.
